# Anicards-App
This project was developed as the final project for the first year of the DTAM CTeSP course from ESMAD.  

The project goal was to develop an Android Native App with a Pop Culture theme. Me and my group friend decided to make an Anime managing App.
Features:
- Google Account Login Required;
- Search for Animes;
- Check Anime Infos;
- Add Animes to Collections (ie: Liked, disliked, seen...);
- Check your profile data (such as animes added to collections in total, collections...).
> Consumes data from an API and makes use of Firebase for the database.

It was developed natively for Android, writen in Java, compatible from Android 5.0.0 and beyond.
